# web-components-playground

Exploring and playing around with [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)!

## Goals

- Use templates
- Use custom elements
- Use event listeners
- Add scoped styles

### Bonus

- Host online
- Make some styles globally sharable
- Server side rendering
- Keep setup minimal. 0 dependency setup if possible, we will see how this will hold once we get to Server side rendering.

## Run

```sh
npx serve
```
